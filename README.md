# Pricing Factors in Neighborhoods of Different Social Classes

This repository contains an analysis of the factors that influence pricing in neighborhoods of different social classes in SÃ£o Paulo. The study focuses on two clusters representing apartments located in peripheral areas (Cluster 1) and central regions (Cluster 0) of the city.

## Findings
Cluster 1: Apartments in peripheral areas, further away from the city center, showed that the number of bathrooms emerged as the predominant factor in determining apartment prices. Buyers or tenants in these areas value apartments with a greater number of bathrooms, indicating a preference for larger, more functional living spaces.

Cluster 0: Apartments in central regions, closer to the city center, revealed that the number of bathrooms is not as influential. Instead, the unit price and usable area play a more significant role in pricing. Higher unit prices and larger usable areas are associated with apartments in desirable locations, showcasing luxurious features and reflecting their premium value.

## Insights
Location Matters: The location of an apartment significantly impacts its pricing. Peripheral areas prioritize practicality and space (reflected by the number of bathrooms), while central areas focus on location, quality, and overall desirability (reflected by unit price and usable area).

Tailoring Strategies: Stakeholders in the real estate market can benefit from understanding these differences to tailor their strategies based on the specific clusters. This enables them to cater to the preferences and needs of potential buyers or tenants in different social classes.
